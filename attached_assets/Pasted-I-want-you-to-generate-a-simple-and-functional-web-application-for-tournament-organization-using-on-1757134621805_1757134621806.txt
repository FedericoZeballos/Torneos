I want you to generate a simple and functional web application for tournament organization, using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks).

General Requirements:
  - The application must be connected to a database (it can be simulated with JSON or a local file for the prototype).
  - It must include a login and user registration system.
  - Administrators can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Tournaments, Teams, Players, and Matches.
  - Non-registered users can browse and view public tournament information.

Main Features:
  1. User Login / Registration
     - Basic validation of username and password.
     - Roles: administrator / regular user.

  2. Tournament Management (CRUD for admins only)
     - Create, edit, and delete tournaments.
     - Each tournament must store: name, description/rules, dates, format (e.g., knockout, league).

  3. Teams and Players Management (CRUD for admins only)
     - Add and edit teams with name, optional logo, and player list.
     - Add players with name, age, optional position.

  4. Match Management (CRUD for admins only)
     - Schedule matches within a tournament.
     - Store date, time, participating teams, and results.

  5. Main Interface (accessible to all)
     - Display details of a selected tournament:
       - Basic information (name, rules, dates, format).
       - List of registered teams and/or players.
       - Fixture/bracket or standings table (simple list or table is fine).
     - Display results of played matches.
     - Display updated standings or bracket.

  6. Additional Database Functions
     - Allow team/player registration to tournaments.
     - Automatic or manual generation of fixtures.
     - Result recording by administrators.
     - Automatic calculation of standings or bracket progression.
     - Tournament history with basic statistics.

Technical Requirements:
  - Use HTML + CSS for the interface.
  - Use JavaScript for application logic.
  - Use JSON as a simulated database for storing users, tournaments, teams, players, and matches.
  - Write modular, well-structured, and commented code to make it easy to understand and extend.
